Courses in the Topics in Social Theory and Practice series feature in-depth considerations of such topics with reflections on their implications for social change.

The topic for Fall 2014 is race and racism. We will consider a variety of arguments for and against the biological and / or social "reality" of raceâ€”taking into account purported races other than those defined by the black / white binary and the intersection of race with other social categories. We will then consider a number of accounts of racism, contemporary manifestations of racism, and potential counter-measures.
